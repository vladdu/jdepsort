h2. Overview

"Robert 'Uncle Bob' Martin":http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html argues in his "Clean code" that the methods in a Java class should be sorted like this:
- public methods on top
- then private methods the above are calling
- then private methods the above are calling
- and so on

I couldn't find any tool to do this sorting (because doing it manually is too boring :-) so I will see if I can find time to implement it myself.

If anyone reads this and knows of another tool (even commercial) that can spare me the effort, please send me a note! Thanks!
